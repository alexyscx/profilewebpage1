                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Alex Sun. I was born in China and came to New Zealand in 2019 when I was 9 years old. Some of my hobbies are chess, badminton, and football.
                
                I started playing chess last year a few weeks before the regionals tournament. We won that tournament and qualified for nationals. We came 4th in this year's tournament and failed to qualify for nationals.
                
                I started playing badminton 3 years ago and am currently part of the Counties Manukau U17 team. This year will be my second year representing Counties Manukau in nationals.
                
                I started playing football this year after joining the 14A2 football team for my school. </p>

 <h2>My Culture</h2>
 <p>I am from Guangzhou, China, a city known for its rich history and cultural diversity. Famous for its delicious Cantonese cuisine and bustling commerce, Guangzhou blends traditional Chinese heritage with modern innovation. Celebrations like Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival highlight the city's vibrant customs and communal spirit. Growing up here has given me a deep appreciation for the arts, language, and traditions that shape my identity.</p>

                <h2>Personal Values</h2>
                <p>
                    I believe in the importance of dedication, always putting my best effort into everything I do, whether it's academics, sports, or personal projects. Respect is fundamental to me, as treating others with kindness and consideration builds positive relationships. My strong curiosity drives me to explore different subjects and develop a deeper understanding of the world around me. I value resilience, the ability to overcome challenges and bounce back from setbacks, helping me stay positive and move forward even when things get tough. Lastly, teamwork is essential in my life; working collaboratively with others enables us to achieve more together than we could individually.
